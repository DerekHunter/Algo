<p>Algorithmic trading is using software to control every aspect of a trading process, from collecting data to making decisions based on that data, and executing those trades. More
information can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">here.</a> </p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>
<p> Most college students don't have the capital required to do trading in the stock market. With commmission fees as high as $10 per trade that just completely destroys any chance of making money with less than $1000.
That's where <a href = "https://www.robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a> comes in. With $0 trades this opens up opportunity to make money with low capital. The goal of this project is to work alongside Robinhood
for smarter investing. The general goal is to create a piece of software that will get todays stock data information, and give the user a prediction on closing prices of stocks
The user then executes the trades manually in the morning, and at the end of the day sells their holdings.</p>

<p>This software has two pieces. The backtester which is given a start and end date, and  will run through each of those days like a live day and make predictions and simulate trades.
The second piece is for a user to do real trading. This piece is given todays date, and will generate a prediction on what it thinks the closing price will be.</p>

<h5>Tools</h5>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://numpy.org/">Numpy</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://scipy.org/">Scipy</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://pybrain.org/">Pybrain</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Sklearn</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/TA-Lib">talib</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Methods</h5>
<p>As mentioned earlier the trader implements the the strategy of buy on open sell on close. The backtester gives the prediction engine a day and ticker symbol. The engine then
goes and downloads a few months of bar data from yahoo finance and with that generates a set of features for each day in the training data, and uses that to train the neural network.
From there it takes todays current information and feeds that into the neural network to make a prediction on todays closing price of the stock.</p>

<p> If this is running in the backtester the backtester then looks at if that's higher than todays open price. It simulates a buy and sell action and adds the result to it's capital.</p>
<p> If it is running in live mode it simply displays the predictions.</p>

<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>
<p>To use this simply put the tickers you want into ticker.csv then run the daily_prediction.py script to get the predictions for the current day(note: if you run it after market closes the predictions
	will still be for that day, you can use this to check performance of the algo). It will then give you an output of your tickers and their predicted close price for that day.</p>
<p>
	Running the backtester is a little bit more involved. You will need to open the backtest.py file and manually change the timeframe object to set hte start and end date. The rest is the same, and the algo.
	Simply modify tickers.csv to contain the tickers you're interested in, then run backtester.py. This will then give you an output of the day in the backtest, the date of that day, current capital, and for each day
	it will give the the ticker, it's open, close, change, prediction, error, and pct error. At the end of the full backtest it will show you plot of the traders account value over that duration of the backtest.

<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h3>
<p>As it turns out, there's a good reason quantitative analysts get paid a lot of money to try and model the stock market, and that's because it's really not easy to do.
Shown belown is the backtest over a 6th month period from March to September 2015. As you can see, the algorithm really doesn't perform all that well. It kind of does okay
early but really falls off later on. The biggest conclusion to draw is don't trust this program with actual money, you're gonna have a bad time.</p>

<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>I think the biggest problem with my idea was that it's essentially trying to scalp on daily movements. I think the best way instead of implementing a fixed policy like
buy on open sell on close one should build in flexibility for instance trying to model out the next 3 or 4 days instead of just 7 hours ahead</p>
